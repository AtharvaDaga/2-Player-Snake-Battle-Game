# 2 Player Snake Battle Game

üêç Snake Battle ‚Äì Human vs AI Showdown:

Snake Battle is a strategic, two-player arcade game where a human-controlled snake competes against an AI-driven opponent within a dynamic grid-based environment. This project exemplifies intelligent behavior modeling, real-time decision-making, and adaptive pathfinding through algorithmic logic.

üéÆ Game Description:

-> AI Player (Player 1) intelligently navigates the grid using Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm to compute the most efficient route to the food while avoiding obstacles and responding to dynamic game states.

-> Human Player (Player 2) controls their snake via arrow key inputs, relying on reflexes, spatial awareness, and tactical positioning.

-> The objective for both players is to consume food, grow in length, and accumulate points‚Äîwhile skillfully avoiding collisions with boundaries, themselves, and each other.

üß† Core Features:

-> Intelligent Pathfinding: AI utilizes Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm (or optionally A*) to calculate optimal paths.

-> Responsive Controls: Real-time input handling enables smooth keyboard-based navigation.

-> Robust Collision Logic: Detection mechanisms for wall, self, and opponent collisions.

-> Competitive Scoring System: Food consumption increases length and score, determining the match outcome.

-> Engaging Visuals: Clean animations and vivid graphics enhance the gameplay experience.

-> Cross-Platform Capability: Compatible with both desktop and Raspberry Pi environments via GPIO support.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Employed:

-> Python  
-> Pygame Library  
-> Graph-based Search Algorithms (Dijkstra‚Äôs / A*)

<br>

üìå Notable Aspects:

-> Integrates classic arcade mechanics with modern AI logic.  
-> Demonstrates foundational AI concepts, real-time user interaction, and interactive software design.
